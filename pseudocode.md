TODO Your pseudocode goes here!
1. If the pile of books you have is 0 or 1 it is already sorted youre done
2. If pile has more than 2 book continue to next step
3. Lets assume we want to sort book with numbers before the alphabet. Assume the first book in the pile is first.
4. Look at each title that comes after your current book.
5. If you find a book that comes before it alphabetically mark that as your new alphabetical lead book.
6. Once you have compared all book titles swap your alphabetical lead book with your current book.
7. Repeat from step 4 for each book until you reach the second to last book.
8. Your pile is sorted
